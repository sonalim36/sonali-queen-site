        <h1>Freddie Mercury</h1>
        <h2>(1970–1991; his death)</h2>
        <h2>Stone Town, Zanzibar</h2>
        <h5>Vocals, keyboards</h5>
        &lt;p&gt;Farrokh Bulsara (5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991), known professionally as Freddie Mercury, was a British singer-songwriter and record producer, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. He was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t Stop Me Now&quot;, &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. He led a solo career while performing with Queen, and occasionally served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury was born of Parsi descent on Zanzibar, and grew up there and in India before moving with his family to Middlesex, England, in his late teens. He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992, Mercury was posthumously awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. As a member of Queen, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2002, he was placed number 58 in the BBC&#39;s 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He is consistently voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music.&lt;/p&gt;

        <h1>Brian May</h1>
        <h2>(1970–present)</h2>
        <h2>Hampton, England</h2>
        <h5>Guitar, keyboards, vocals</h5>
        &lt;p&gt;Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and photographer. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the band&#39;s members; and in 2018, he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which recognises &quot;the most distinctive recordings in music history&quot;. He uses a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. His compositions for the band include &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;Flash&quot;, &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;, &quot;Save Me&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone magazine&#39;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2012, May was ranked the 2nd greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine readers poll.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the drummer for the rock band Queen. As a drummer, Taylor was recognised early in his career for his unique sound. He was voted by radio listeners as the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history in a poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen&#39;s albums from the very beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s (&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;Innuendo&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot;) and contributed a further five major hits (&quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;, &quot;Breakthru&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;). He is also commonly known to have been the main writer on the international top-ten hit &quot;One Vision&quot;, although the track is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin&#39; Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his drum work, Taylor sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show Pop Quiz, hosted by Mike Read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <h1>John Deacon</h1>
        <h2>(1971–1997)</h2>
        <h2>Leicester, England</h2>
        <h5>Bass, guitar, keyboards</h5>
        &lt;p&gt;John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired musician, best known for being the bass guitarist for the rock band Queen. He composed several singles for the group—including Top 10 hits &quot;You&#39;re My Best Friend&quot;, &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, &quot;Back Chat&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;—and was involved in the band&#39;s financial management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, before moving to study electronics at Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen&#39;s career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen&#39;s studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records, though he did contribute backing vocals during live performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following frontman Freddie Mercury&#39;s death in 1991, and the following year&#39;s Tribute Concert, Deacon only performed a few times with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music industry in 1997 after recording &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;. He has not performed on any of the other projects that the other two surviving members, May and Roger Taylor, have put together.&lt;/p&gt;
